I recently completed the first [deep learning course](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=lVarvwc5BD0&offerid=467035.11421701992&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fneural-networks-deep-learning) by Andrew Ng and I definitely am feeling enlightened. Takes me back to those early days when Andrew came up with his first [machine learning course](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=lVarvwc5BD0&offerid=467035.1560515719&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fmachine-learning).

About the course, Andrew has achieved mastery in explaining difficult concepts in an easy to understand way. The nomenclature he follows is different from all other tutorials and courses on the net, and I hope it catches on as it is pretty helpful in understanding all the basic concepts.

In this first course he teaches about how to create a deep learning network from scratch without using any tools like keras/tensorflow. This itself provides the much needed intuition into the whole process.

The course itself touches maths, but not very heavily. A little hand waving when it comes to calculus where Andrew sort of gives results without proving them. But that is not to say you cannot prove those results. A little extra effort from your side and you will definitely understand the proofs.

Andrew teaches the whole forward propogation and back propogation concept effortlessly. The below image would be the highlight of this course for me where all the formulas you need to implement a basic deep learning network are listed.

Although he has still not touched on a lot of other techniques that are quite famous like dropoff, convolution etc. this course develops the basic building blocks that will be helpful going forward.

Thanks Andrew!
